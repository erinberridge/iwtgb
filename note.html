<p>Let it be known to the reader, I have only ever bought one pack of cigarettes in my life.
 And they must have had something in them, because I was awful until the last one was gone.
 Maybe my lucky one was <u><a onclick="showFootnote()">unlucky</a></u> and I had to burn it to get it gone.</p>

<p id="footnote" style="display:none">Paranoid and superstitious people should not smoke.</p>

<script>
function showFootnote() {
    var footnote = document.getElementById("footnote");
    footnote.style.display='block';
}
</script>
